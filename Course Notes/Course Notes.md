## Introduction to HTML

Aggregated web dev doumentation can be found at devdocs.io.

Emmet abbreviations can be found at emmet.io.

### Tags

Most tags need to be closed explicitly. Some, like ```<br>``` or ```<hr>``` don't (or can't). The rules can be found in the "tag omission" section of each tag's doc page.

Each tag can also accept certain attributes such as size or color.

### Comments

HTML comment syntax is kind of clunky but this is how it looks: ```<!-- I'm a comment -->```.

### HTML Boilerplate

Meta tags are supplied in the ```<head>``` section of HTML files.

Unicode UTF-8 (```<meta charset="UTF-8">```) should be used as the default encoding attribute. In addition to text scripts, Unicode also has other non-text symbols like emojis.

The ```description``` meta-element attribute sets the text that will be displayed under the title of the webpage in search engine results.
